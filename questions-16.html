<h3>I want to have peace with God!  What do I do?</h3>
<p><strong>1)  RECOGNIZE GODS PLAN - PEACE AND LIFE.  God loves you and wants you to experience His peace and life.  The Bible says: &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.&quot;  John 3:16


2)  REALIZE OUR PROBLEM - SEPARATION.  People choose to disobey God and go their own way.  This results in separation from God.  The Bible says: &quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&quot;  Romans 3:23


3)  RESPOND TO GODS REMEDY - THE CROSS OF CHRIST.  God sent His Son to bridge the gap.  Christ did this by paying the penelty for our sins when He died on the cross and rose from the grave.  The Bible says: &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;  Romans 5:8


4)  RECEIVE GODS SON - THE LORD AND SAVIOR.  You cross the bridge into Gods family when you ask Christ to come into your life.  The Bible says:  &quot;But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name.&quot;  John 1:12


THE INVITATION IS TO turn from your sin and by faith receive Jesus Christ into your heart and life and follow Him in obedience as your Lord and Savior.  PRAY A PRAYER like this:  &quot;Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner.  I believe You died for my sins.  Right now, I turn from my sins and open the door of my heart and life.  I receive You as my personal Lord and Savior.  Thank You for saving me now.  Amen.&quot;</strong></p>
