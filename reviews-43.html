  <h4> - Fandango CD review</h4>
  <p>
  FANDANGO - Eric Rombach-Kendall, cond; University of New Mexico Wind Symphony.<br>Philip Smith (tpt); Joseph Alessi (tbn) - SUMMIT SMT 271 (62:53)<br><br>GOLDSTEIN Colloquy. TURRIN Chronicle. Fandango. BOURGEOIS Concerto for Trombone and Concert Band. GRYC Evensong<br><br>Another fine CD of wind music from Summit. Two exceptional first-desk<br>New York Philharmonic players-Philip Smith on trumpet and Joseph Alessi<br>on trombone-team up with the outstanding University of New Mexico Wind Symphony for a program of compositions that neatly balance virtuosity, instrumental color, and substance.<br><br>The CD steps off in high spirits with Colloquy for trombone and symphonic band by New Jersey-bom William Goldstein (b. 1942), a former<br>student of Giannini and Flagello at the Manhattan School of Music, and a<br>veteran composer for TV and films. Written in 1967 "during a most difficult period of national angst," the youthful influence of Copland and Bernstein is felt, as the composer was "filled with a desire to inspire." The music is somewhat jazzy (with a particularly Bemsteinesque slow central section) and is infectiously swinging in its finale. A good showpiece.<br><br>Chronicles for trumpet and wind ensemble and Fandango for trumpet,<br>trombone, and symphonic band are the first commercially recorded works<br>of Joseph Turrin (b. 1947), whose splendid NYP-commissioned Trumpet<br>Concerto of 1988 is one of the highlights of the 1990 WQXR/NY<br>Philharmonic Radiothon Special Edition, Vol. 111, CD. Turrin, like<br>Goldstein, New Jersey born, a former student of Flagello at Manhattan,<br>and a veteran composer for TV and films, thus considers Chronicles (1998) his unofficial Second Trumpet Concerto; it is both driving and melodic, with a fanfare figure that recurs as a unifying element. The expected lyrical middle movement is nonetheless not devoid of tensions that are released in the somewhat processional finale.<br><br>The Trombone Concerto (1988) of English-bom, 59-year-old composer Derek Bourgeois has already become a staple of the trombone literature-in all<br>three of its versions: with orchestra, with brass band, and, as recorded here, with concert band. Formal though the concerto is-it is<br>conservative and Romantically tuneful-the piece is just plain irresistible. Themes are aubum-hued, and the nearly 10-minute first movement is nearly a miniature trombone concerto in its own right. The second movement, featuring a trombone quartet in places, offers elegant,<br>rich lines of a Malcolm Arnold-like, folksy character. The third<br>movement, a broad march in rondo form, is a slide-and-tongue twister for<br>the soloist.<br><br>Stephen Gryc (b. 1949), a St. Paul native, contributes Evensong for<br>trumpet and symphonic band (1999-2000), commissioned by the forces heard here. As its church-service title implies, Evensong is restrained and<br>hymnal. Ancient dorian and mixolydian modes tend a slightly dark edge to the music, and soloist Smith produces a beautifully controlled plaintive tone.<br><br>Joseph Turrin returns with the CDs eponymous Fandango for trumpet,<br>trombone, and symphonic band (2000). The piece is pure color and<br>syncopated, triple-time Spanish rhythms. Though rather fluffy, the<br>duo-solo composition provides a lively and satisfying summertime<br>band-concert conclusion to the program.<br><br>Music fans, ahoy! Regardless of the temperature as you read this, the<br>winds are up, and you should prepare to voyage to a Web site or store to seek out Fandango.<br>Stephen Ellis
