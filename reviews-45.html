  <h4> - Impetuosities review</h4>
  <p>
   Delightful, Mostly Light-Hearted, Occasionally Wacky, Music, June 23, 2003 <br><br>Reviewer: J Scott Morrison (see more about me)  from Shawnee Mission, KS USA Joshua Rosenblum is a young composer-conductor-pianist who has worked mostly on- and off-Broadway, conducting shows like Miss Saigon, The Music Man, and Falsettos. This CD, which must have been a joy to put together - there is a palpable feeling of hey-kids-lets-put-on-a-show collegiality amongst the numerous musicians involved - contains a variety of chamber music. Rosenblum probably sets a record for using the youngest librettist for his song-cycle, A Whole Family Sitting in a Tree. He followed his then-three-year-old son, Julian, around with paper and pencil and copied down his sayings, setting his words as five songs. The only other art-songs that even come close, in my experience, are the delightful Deux lettres denfants by Jacques de Menasce, who set a couple of charming thank-you notes sent him by the children of fellow composer, Daniel Lesur. Rosenblums are worthy of such company. The song-cycle is winningly sung by young Julians mama and Joshuas wife, Joanne Lessner. Music, words and performance are utterly charming.<br>The album is titled Impetuosities, after the first piece recorded here, a jeu desprit written on commission for Philip Smith, the fabled principal trumpet of the New York Philharmonic and played by him and pianist Joseph Turrin. Impetuosities is an immediately attractive 7-minute romp that must be fun to play; it certainly is fun to listen to. Smith is quoted as saying, when he commissioned the piece, that he wasnt really an avant-garde guy, to which Rosenblum replied, Thats okay - neither am I. Indeed, all the music here is resolutely tonal, immediately gettable.<br>Variations for piano trio, here played by The Herrick Trio, consists of a flowing theme and seven variations that include a jig, a calypso-rag, a waltz, and an Orientale, among others. The Trios violinist, Marilyn Gibson, also plays Marilyns Solo, a brief unaccompanied bijou written for her. Four Songs of Thomas Hardy, the most consciously arty music here nonetheless contains a hilarious setting of In the Room of the Bride-Elect that ends with the cry, Good God - I must marry him I suppose! The four are sung by baritone Chris Thompson with impeccable diction and suave musicality.<br>Flash Variations for flute and piano flutters past in roulades and runs played with gusto and skill by Kathleen Nester, flute, with the composer at the piano. <br>Tall Tales for horn quartet is played by some Broadway pit-band buddies of the composer. They call themselves The Shubert Alley Horns and, if the booklet can be trusted, they sight-read the light-hearted pieces for this recording. One of the Horns, Dan Culpepper, also plays Three Episodes for horn and piano, again with the composer at the piano. <br>Finally, a couple of wind-band pieces, a march (coyly called Forward March) and a sort-of-tarantella called The Kings Pyjamas, are played by a group of other Broadway musicians calling themselves - in homage to John Philip Sousa, after one of his marches - Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. A good time is had by all, including this reviewer. <br>Indeed, for a light-hearted 72 minutes this CD would more than adequately fill the bill. Were told Mr Rosenblum is preparing a Broadway musical based on, of all things, physicist/novelist Alan Lightmans fictional Einsteins Dreams. Hoo boy!<br>Review by Scott Morrison
