  <h4>American Record Guide - Philip Smith-New York Legends</h4>
  <p>
  “This is one of the best trumpet recordings ever made. Philip Smith, who joined the New York Philharmonic as co-principal trumpet in 1978 and became principal trumpet in 1988, has imagination, superb technique, versatility, and a round tone that stays that way even in extremes of dynamics and register. The program is full of variety and quality. Joseph Turrin’s piano accompaniment is authoritative, a perfect match for a remarkable soloist. Brass literature has been enriched in recent years by some terrific works by Eric Ewazen. Scored for trumpet, violin and piano and trumpet, his Trio (1992) is full of his signature rhythms, chord progressions, and melodic gestures. The 21-minute Trio has three lively movements and a gorgeous slow one that is a riveting as the others. The excellent violinist is Sharon Yamada of the New York Philharmonic. Turrin’s Intrada was written for Smith in 1988. Smith plays the warm toned flugelhorn in Turrin’s Two Portraits (1995) and cornet in Richard Lane’s Song for a Cornet (written for Smith’s father in 1975). Georges Enescu’s Légende and Henri Tomasi’s wild Triptyque are all-time favorites of mine. The spectacular 8-player trumpet ensemble (conducted by Turrin) is hear in Bruce Broughton’s Concert Piece, Turrin’s Festival Fanfare, and Terry Iverson’s arrangement of W. L. Thompson’s There’s a Great Day Coming.” American Record Guide, September/October,1998 <br>
