<h3>What will happen if I ask Jesus into my life? </h3>
<p><strong>Jesus came to free us from sin and to give us the gift of eternal life.  The Bible says in John 1:12, &quot;Yet to all who received Him, to those who believed in His name, He gave the right to become children of God.&quot; In John 11:25-26 we read, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life.  He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never die.  Do you believe this?&quot; See also Romans 6:22-23
